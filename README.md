# Video Sync Controller

[LIVE DEMO](https://video-frame-sync.vercel.app/)

My attempt at syncing two videos in JS with React.

Basic idea is that the frames are synced through the one video source which is then drawn on to the canvas elements.

I've also included the naive attempt at syncing the two native players.
